# Continuation of Unreal Engine 4: AI


## What you built? 

I followed a tutorial to create a simple setup for a game where randomly spawned AI characters will see and interact with each other (move to, attack, etc.). In this case, the AIs are cute little muffins roaming within a fenced area.

Here's a screenshot testing out these AI characters using the built-in "sight" AI perception walking towards each other to form a cluster:

## What you learned

I attempted to expand my knowledge of what the Unreal Engine 4 is capable of creating without any additional packages/downloads in terms of artificial intelligence. I learned about the built-in AI classes and was surprised at just how much capability they already had, such as methods for different senses (and even which sense should be dominant) and a visual behavioral tree editor. It seems to have a lot of functionality that could make creating a game demo a lot easier than expected, 
but as with the first hack-a-thing, I am curious/skeptical about the feasability and difficulty of creating more complex, not planned for behaviors.
