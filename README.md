# Continuation of Unreal Engine 4: AI


## What you built? 

I attempted to expand my knowledge of what the Unreal Engine 4 is capable of creating without any additional packages/downloads in terms of artificial intelligence. To do this, I followed a tutorial to create a simple setup for a game where randomly spawned AI characters will see and interact with each other (move to, attack, etc.).

Here's a screenshot testing out these AI characters using the built-in "sight" AI perception walking towards each other to form a cluster:
